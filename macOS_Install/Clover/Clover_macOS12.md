## I. Requirements

- macOS Monterey. Either download it through System Updates, from the App Store or with OpenCore Legacy Patcher
- [**OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP)**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) &rarr; Click on "Assets" and download "OpenCore-Patcher-GUI-App". We'll need it in Post-Install to re-install the missing drivers for Intel HD4000 on-board graphics. 
- USB Installer for clean install (optional)
- My EFI Folder
- **SMBIOS**:
	- When coming from macOS Catalina or older: use `MacBookPro11,4` for installation (&rarr; see "Note about SMBIOS")
	- When upgrading from Big Sur 11.3 or newer: stay on `MacBookPro10,1` (i7) or `MacBookPro10,2` (i5)

### Note about SMBIOS
The board-id skip used in my configuration that allows using the `MacBookPro10,x` SMBIOS with Big Sur and newer requires virtualization technology which got introduced with macOS 11.3. Therefore, you can't simply upgrade from macOS Catalina or older with the `MacBookPro10,X` SMBIOS since the board-id skip doesn't work due to the missing virtualization technology. It only works on a systems running Darwin Kernel 20.4 or newer. In other words: upgrading macOS only works when coming from Big Sur 11.3+ in this case.

Since Clover cannot apply the necessary Booter Patches required for the [Board-ID VMM spoof](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/09_Board-ID_VMM-Spoof) to work which allows installing OTA updates on otherwise unsupported hardware, a different approach is necessary. Instead, `-no_compat_check` is used to skip the board-id check which allows booting macOS Ventura as `MacBookPro10,x` and `RestrictEvents.kext` with boot-arg `revpatch=sbvmm` is used to enable the `VMM-x86_64` Board-ID, so OTA updates will work.

So when upgrading from macOS Catalina or older, you need to temporarily switch the SMBIOS to `MacBookPro11,4` in order to be able to install macOS Monterey. You can revert it back to `MacBooPro10,1` (i7) or `MacBookPro10,2` (i5) once the installation has finished,

## II. macOS Monterey Install Instruction

### 1. Install macOS Monterey
<details>
<summary><strong>Option 1: Updating an existing Install</strong></summary>

**Option 1**: Updating an existing macOS Monterey Installation

- Download OCLP
- Mount the ESP Partition
- Paste in my Clover EFI Folder and edit the `config.plist`:
	- Under `Boot/Arguments`add `-no_compat_check`
	- Generate SMBIOS data for `MacBookPro10,1` or `MacBookPro10,2`
	- Change `CsrActiveConfig` to: `0xFEF` (a must to be able to boot)
- Run the "Install macOS Monterey" App
- There will be a few reboots
- Boot from the new macOS Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Menu

Continue with Step 2.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Option 2: Clean Install (recommended)</strong></summary>

**Option 2**: Clean Install (recommended)

To create a USB Installer, do the following:

- Create a new Partition on your HDD/SSD or use a separate disk (at least 60 GB in size)
- Attach an empty USB flash drive for creating the installer (16 GB+)
- Run OCLP and follow the [**instructions**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html#creating-the-installer) to create the USB Installer
- Once the USB Installer has been created, do the following:
	- Copy the OpenCore-Patcher App to the USB Installer (and Clover Configurator or your plist Editor of choice as well)
	- Mount the EFI Partition of the USB flash drive
	- Paste in my EFI Folder 
	- Rename `config_Ventura.plist` to `config.plist`
	- Generate SMBIOS data for `MacBookPro10,1` (Core i7) or `MacBookPro10,2` (Core i5)
- Reboot from USB flash drive and run "Install macOS Ventura"
- There will be a few reboots along the way. Boot from the new Install Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker
- Once the Installation is finished, copy the EFI folder from the USB Installer to the EFI partition on your HDD/SSD
</details>

### 2. Install Intel HD4000 Drivers

Once you reach the set-up assistant (where you set language, time zone, etc), you will notice that the system feels super sluggish â€“ that's normal because it is running in VESA mode without graphics acceleration, since the friendly guys at Apple removed the Intel HD 4000 drivers. 

To bring them back, do the following:

- Copy the OpenCore-Patcher App from you USB Installer to the Desktop
- Double-click to run it 
- In the OpenCore Legacy Patcher menu, select "Post Install Root Patch":</br>![menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920348-21a3abad-311f-49c6-b4d9-25e6560b6150.png)
- Next, click on "Start Root Patching":</br>![menu2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920368-bdfff312-6390-40a5-9af8-8331569fbe17.png)
- The App has to relaunch with Admin Roots. Click Yes:</br>![yes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920381-2b6a4194-60c3-472e-81bb-c5478e3298f9.png)
- You will have to enter your Admin Password and then the installation will begin:</br>![Install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920398-38ddf7c5-0dfd-428e-9d7a-5646010d3c08.png)
- Once it's done, you have to reboot and Graphics acceleration will work:</br>![2048](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920410-28cc08d2-0bcd-4868-b30d-112caec7206d.png)

Graphics Acceleration should work now and the system should feel as usual again and you can continue with the Post-Install process as described in the Repo.

## III. OCLP and System Updates
The major advantage of using OCLP over HD4000 Patcher is that it remains on the system even after installing System Updates. After a system update, it detects that the graphics drivers are missing and asks you, if you want to to patch them in again:</br>![Notify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181934588-82703d56-1ffc-471c-ba26-e3f59bb8dec6.png)

You just click on "Okay" and the drivers will be re-installed. After the obligatory reboot, everything will be back to normal.

## Notes
- Installing drivers on the system partition breaks its security seal. This affects System Updates: every time a System Update is available, the FULL Installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded.
- After each System Update, the Drivers have to be re-installed. OCLP should take care of it.
- If installing HD 4000 Drivers with OCLP poses an issue when using Clover as the Boot Manager, try [Patch HD 4000 Monterey](https://github.com/chris1111/Patch-HD4000-Monterey) instead.
